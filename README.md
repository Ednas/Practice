# Snort rules

## Snort rules lab

I've got my first snort rules in the [Immersivelabs.rules](./immersivelabs.rules) file. These are the solutions from my attempt at solving the Snort labs and are organized by Episode and questions. These are not intended to be put into use as is, but are more for my reference and review as I learn more and add to my knowledge.

## Local rules

The other snort rules here are from [Security for real people](securityforrealpeople.com/snort-dns). These I've tested and actually work. You need to update your IP addresses in the IP array.
